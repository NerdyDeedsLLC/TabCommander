                Got WAY too many tabs open? How about browser windows? Can't find the tab you were JUST staring at?
                Maybe you're done shopping and you want ALL of your Amazon and eBay tabs closed? No problem.
                <br><br>
                TabCommander is a powerful <a>tab management</a> extension for Chrome. But don't take my word for it:
                <br><br>
                <center><video></video></center>
                <br>
                Using nothing but a few keystrokes in the <a>OmniBox</a>, users gain godlike command-line abilities
                to <a>search</a>, <a>sort</a>, <a>group</a>, <a>consolidate</a>, <a>extract</a>, and <a>discard</a>
                <a>any number</a> of open tabs (from <a>all open windows</a>, or <a>just the active one</a>)!
                <br><br>
                Tab Commander leverages the search capabilities and power of <a>Regular Expressions</a>, so you can instantly
                <a>filter their open tabs</a> (scanning both page titles and domains) and effect actions on them
                en masse, all without leaving the current page!

                    Chrome's omnibox is similar to the traditional web browser address
                    bar, but you can also use it like a search engine.
                    <img src="https://assets.codepen.io/678043/omnibar_math.jpg" />
                    As seen in the
                    picture, the omnibox in Google Chrome can also perform mathematical
                    calculations and even answer questions such as "how many cups are
                    in 2 liters?"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More importantly, though, it can also be modified by a clever
                    extension developer to do all sorts of additional voodoo.

            <dd>Well, then you lucked out! TabCommander supports both standard ECMA Regular
                Expressions, as well as SimplEx (Simplified Expression) syntax!
                <br><br>
                <b>Don't know SimplEx, Either?</b><br>
                Not to worry! SimplEx is to RegEx what MarkDown is to HTML+CSS. There are
                only a half-dozen <a>flags</a> to learn (single characters at the start of
                your search query) that will provide very nearly as much power and utility
                as a longhand RegEx statement would!
                <br><br>
                Don't believe me? Here, <a>check it out!</a>

                SimplEx is another OpenSource project I'm in the midst of developing.
                <br><br>
                Think of it as Markdown for RegEx: instead of having to learn all the various rules, procedures,
                and orders of operation of RegEx, you simply need to learn <a>7 simple, intuitive, and, best of all,
                    OPTIONAL rules</a>, and you can leverage MOST of the search capabilities of RegEx!

            <dd>
                Just like in Markdown, there are two types of syntax rules in SimplEx: <br>
                <ul>

                        Inline rules are applicable multiple times within the same query. They are
                        flags can than be activated or deactivated for each search TERM (instead of 
                        the WHOLE QUERY).<br> They include:

                        <br>
                        Whole-query rules are rules that only need to be activated once, at the

                        The "inline syntax" simply means that the search control is used right alongside your
                        search terms. They are:

                                <em>By default, it's considered a "match" if a search term appears ANYWHERE, even as part of another word ("dandi<u>lions</u>", "<u>tigers</u>eye", "<u>bears</u>kin")</em>
                                <br>To add an "or" condition to your search query <br>
                                ("<code>lions <b>or</b> tigers </u></b><b>or</b> bears</code>"),
                                simply separate the search terms with one or more pipe character (|). <br>
                                <br><u>Example:</u> <br>
                                <code>"lions<b>┃</b>tigers<b>┃</b>bears"</code> will return all tabs whose
                                domain or title contains any of those three terms!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ❗️ <i><b>Logical 'NOT':</b></i>
                                Prefacing a search term with a bang (!) will EXCLUDE any results containing 
                                it instead of including them. <br>
                                <br><u>Example I:</u> <br>
                                <code>!youtube</code> will gather all tabs EXCEPT those containing youtube in
                                their title or URL.
                                <br><br>
                                Even cooler, though, is you can mix and match includes and excludes! Each Logical OR (|) 
                                is considered a separate search term, so you can negate one or many while requiring one 
                                or many, too!<br>
                                <br><u>Example II:</u> <br>
                                <code>google|yahoo|!bing</code> is the equivalent of saying "find everything
                                containing "google" or "yahoo" (so long as it DOESN'T contain "bing").
                                <br><br>
                                Not exclusions take precidence over inclusions, so you can use them to further refine
                                your results if you're still getting too many, too!<br>
                                <br><u>Example III:</u> <br>
                                <code>hammer|saw|wrench|!mc</code> will return the tools in the garage, but exclude
                                the "too legit" tool from the 90's, even though <code>mc</code> appears <i>after</i>
                                <code>hammer</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <ins>❞</ins> <i><b>Whole-Word-Only Match:</b></i>
                                <br>Only want words that match your term entirely instead of including substrings
                                (e.g. when searching for "laughter", don't show "s<u>laughter</u>" as well)?
                                If you wrap a query or term in double-quotes (") then SimplEx treats it as
                                you searching for the word so wrapped in its entirety <br>
                                <br><u>Example:</u> <br>
                                <code>"eat"</code> WILL match <code>"Eat Bacon"</code>, but will NOT match <code>"Consume Wheaties"</code>)
                                <br><br>
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <h2>FILTERING WITH REGEX</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><a href='#'>"Screw 'SimplEx'; How do I use REGEX?"</a></dt>
            <dd>
                True RegEx Mode was designed to be as comfortable and intuitive to access for developers as possible:
                <br><br>
                Simply type <code>tab</code>, to initialize TabCommander, like you would for any other query, but this time,
                after you hit the spacebar (but before entering a query) type a forward slash (<code>/</code>). That's it.
                You're searching with RegEx!
                <br><br>
                True RegEx Mode runs your query precisely as you enter it, using JavaScript/ECMA syntax: <br>
                <code>/^http:\/\//</code>, for example, would return insecure (those not running in https) tabs only. <br>
                <code>/(?!.*tube)(?&lt;=.*google.*)(you\b)/i</code> will return https://LetMeGoogleThatForYou.com (as well
                as https://lmgtfy.com, since they spell out their whole name in the page title), but will omit your youtube.com
                tabs and ignore the socks you're looking at on Amazon (since both fail the positive lookbehind for 'google').<br><br>
                And yes: the <code>/i</code> and <code>/g</code> flags are supported, as are (pos and neg) lookaheads, lookbehinds,
                capture groups (dunno why you'd care in this case) and all the other ECMARE goodness you've come to expect.<br><br>
                All that seem Greek to you? <a>Check out SimplEx</a> and see how easy it can be!
